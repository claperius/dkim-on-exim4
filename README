This is a small shell script that runs the commands necessary to
enable DKIM for outgoing emails on a standard exim4 installation on
Debian/Ubuntu and the like.  For other distributions, some tweaks are
probably necessary.

After running the script, you will have to add a TXT DNS record for
the domain: The script will tell you what record to add, too.

If you have a more complex setup, with many domains and the like,
you'll probably have to tweak the output somewhat.
